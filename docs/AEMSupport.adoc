== Dependencies

* AEM/CQ
* To run Grabbit in your AEM/CQ instance, **you need to install a Fragment Bundle once per instance. It can be found link:https://bintray.com/artifact/download/twcable/aem/dependencies/Sun-Misc-Fragment-Bundle-1.0.0.zip[here]**

== Below details AEM version support for the various releases of Grabbit.
```
   v7.x - AEM 6.1 and AEM 6.2
   v5.x - AEM 6.1
   v4.x - AEM 6.1
   v3.x - CQ 5.6 and AEM 6.0
   v2.x - CQ 5.6
```
We follow link:http://semver.org/[semantic versioning]. Installation of different major versions between machines are unsupported, and likely incompatible.

Active development is on the "master" branch, which is currently the 6.x version line. Security patches and the like are sometimes back-ported to prior versions.

Of course pull-requests are happily accepted for those that would like to submit things like back-porting features for AEM 5.6, etc.

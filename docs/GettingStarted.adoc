== Prerequisites

=== Installing Protocol Buffers Compiler

==== For Windows
The easiest way to install the compiler is to install the binary from https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/download/v2.6.1/protoc-2.6.1-win32.zip and then set the `/path/to/protoc/parent` on your PATH variable.

==== For Macs

Run ./install_protoc_from_source.sh located at the root of this project. This will compile the protoc compiler

_For both Windows and Mac : To verify that installation was successful, `protoc --version` should display `2.6.1`_

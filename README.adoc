== Project Purpose

The purpose of Grabbit is to provide a fast and reliable way of copying content from one Sling (specifically Adobe CQ/AEM) instance to another.

Existing solutions have been tried and found insufficient for very large data sets (GB-TB), especially over a network. CQ's .zip packages are extremely space inefficient, causing a lot of extra I/O. http://jackrabbit.apache.org/filevault/usage.html[`vlt rcp`] and Mark Adamcin's http://adamcin.net/net.adamcin.recap/[`recap`] use essentially the same mechanism: WebDAV using XML, doing an HTTP handshake for every node and many sets of properties, which means that any latency whatsoever on the network hurts performance enormously.

Grabbit creates a stream of data using https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/[Google's Protocol Buffers] aka "ProtoBuf". Protocol Buffers are an extremely efficient (in terms of CPU, memory and wire size) binary protocol that includes compression.

Moreover, by doing a continuous stream, we avoid the latency issues. Depending on the size and nature of the data, as well as network latency, we have so far seen speed improvements ranging from 2 to 10 times that of Recap/vlt.

NOTE: "Grabbit" obviously refers to this "grabbing" content from one CQ/AEM instance and copying it to another. However it also refers to "Jackrabbit," the reference JCR implementation that the content is being copied to and from.
